	abstract = {The quality of teaching and learning mathematics has been one of the major challenges and concern of the educators especially for students of engineering. Mathematics comprises a wide variety of skills and concepts. One of the main roles of mathematics is the development of the ability to solve problems. Mathematics is often considered as a subject that students find hard to understand, therefore many universities are faced with the problem that students drop out due to mathematics. The aim of the research is to study causes for failure in Mathematics among engineering students. The study is based on the analysis of mathematics test results as well as the survey data analysis. The survey collected data and opinions regarding: 1) the curriculum, 2) the teaching process, 3) the learners: their low basic knowledge, difficulties to understanding, learning habits, attitudes toward learning process, home background, and the learner's emotional reactions and personality. The analysis of the survey results showed that the core problem at the Latvia University of Agriculture is not only insufficient students’ background knowledge in mathematics, but also their attitude towards learning, psychological reaction against the first failure and laziness to make efforts to do additional tasks or attend tutorials.},

Specifically, the research is carried out with 30 engineering students. Auzmendi anxiety factor questions are used to measure anxiety. The study is carried out in two moments; in the first the calculator is not used and in the second if they use it. In the second case, the calculator is used in problems involving the application of derivatives and integrals. The results indicate that the students reduce their anxiety when they use the calculator. Thus, in seven of the nine questions, students who use the calculator obtain a higher mean, it helps to reduce anxiety. In general, t-student test indicates that the moment students use the calculator they have less anxiety, and it helps to reduce errors in the mathematical process. Teachers should consider the calculator as a resource that motivates the student and helps reduce anxiety. In addition, the use of the calculator helps to reduce mathematical errors in basic operations and in the application of derivatives and integrals.},

The review begins with an overview of the literature on worked examples and the associated self-explanation, which is important given that the quality of self-explanation is a major factor in determining whether learners benefit from studying examples. The review notes that example-based learning environments tend to be effective but often promote passive processing. It then highlights the strengths and limitations of three types interactivity introduced to example-based learning environments.

Four modes of instruction were used to teach an engineering fundamentals course in statics. A traditional instructor-led course, a Web-assisted course, a streaming media course, and an interactive video course were all presented using a common syllabus, homework, tests, and grading regimen. Evaluations of final course grades indicate that use of instructional technology improved student performance when compared with traditional teaching methods. Student satisfaction with technology varied considerably with the Web-assisted format having the highest student approval rating of the technologies. The results indicate that time on task and interest in content can be improved through the appropriate use of technology.},

	abstract = {Background The complexity and diversity of problems and concepts in different engineering subjects represent a great challenge for students. Traditional approaches to teaching statics are ineffective in helping some students overcome the learning barriers that underlie learning statics and developing problem-solving skills. Purpose This article explores how self-explanation activities may support student learning in statics. Specifically, this study examines the characteristics of student self-explanations of worked examples and their relationship with students′ conceptual change. Design/Method The study population included 147 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a statics course. The students wrote their self-explanations at each step of an incomplete or incorrect worked example in the context of static equilibrium. Students′ self-explanations were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis to identify the approaches used. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to identify differences in students′ conceptual understanding of statics, based on their approach to self-explanation. Results We identified four self-explaining approaches: restricted explanations, elemental explanations, inferential explanations, and strategic explanations. After completing the activity, students who self-explained incomplete worked examples showed better results in the quality of their explanations and conceptual change than students in the incorrect worked example condition. Conclusions The findings suggest a relationship between the type of worked example, students' approaches to self-explaining, and their conceptual change and problem-solving skills in statics. To increase the quality of the students' explanations and to improve their conceptual understanding, additional prompts or initial training in self-explaining may be required within the worked-examples context.},

First-year engineering students (n=177) participated in the College Math Readiness Test ({CMRT}), a questionnaire on mathematics subjects that covered Precalculus, Analytical Geometry, Series and Mathematical Induction, Trigonometry, and Basic Calculus: Limits and Continuity, Derivatives, and Integration. The findings indicate that 43\% of the respondents were mathematically-college-ready ({MCR}) and 57\% were not-mathematically-college-ready ({NMCR}). Regarding the {NMCR}, 39\% fared fairly and 18\% fared poorly in the {CMRT}. This suggests that remedial support for mathematics for this group may be required for them to be college-ready for an engineering course. The respondents had the lowest correct mean score for the Integration subjects: Evaluating Differential Equations (15\%), Evaluating Definite Integrals (16\%), and Solving Area Between Curves (19\%). The results of the ranking of the Senior High Schools ({SHS}) showed that 13 {SHS} with at least 2 takers and 24 {SHS} with single takers need to improve their quality of teaching to enhance the mathematical competence of their graduates.

	abstract = {This research provides an overview of the challenges faced by college freshmen in understanding Mathematics 1 (College Algebra) and finds that many students end up flunking the subject. The study employed a descriptive-normative quantitative research design, analyzing data collected from 267 college freshmen students which were identified through total random sampling method. A Likert-type survey was used, asking students to rate their mathematical difficulty as freshmen students. By studying responses gathered from students, the research highlights the need for adequate teaching materials, skilled teachers and the provision of textbooks and other supplies for classroom learning. The findings suggest that school heads should prioritize the provision of such teaching materials to ensure a successful learning experience for students in Mathematics 1 (college algebra) and that teachers should be knowledgeable about a discovery approach and given ample time to offer remedial instructions for struggling students. Furthermore, the research establishes that teachers should be well-versed in the subject matter to ensure the best outcome for the students. The implications of this research are clear: school heads and teachers must prioritize student success by providing effective teaching materials and remedial instructions to ensure student comprehension.},

The proposed smart classroom system supports students in conducting learning activities in a multi-screen learning environment. Its goal is to enhance interaction and increase student satisfaction in engineering classroom learning. For the evaluation, an experiment was conducted in a science and engineering-related course at a university in China. The research results show that students who received instruction with the proposed system reported higher satisfaction in four areas: information technology, teaching methods, perceived value, and learning satisfaction. Approximately 90\% of the 629 undergraduate students who participated in the experiment expressed their desire to continue their studies in this smart classroom. This indicates that students are more interested, expectant, helpful, and engaged in the target courses they are taking after using the smart classroom system.},

	abstract = {Background The complexity and diversity of problems and concepts in different engineering subjects represent a great challenge for students. Traditional approaches to teaching statics are ineffective in helping some students overcome the learning barriers that underlie learning statics and developing problem-solving skills. Purpose This article explores how self-explanation activities may support student learning in statics. Specifically, this study examines the characteristics of student self-explanations of worked examples and their relationship with students′ conceptual change. Design/Method The study population included 147 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a statics course. The students wrote their self-explanations at each step of an incomplete or incorrect worked example in the context of static equilibrium. Students′ self-explanations were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis to identify the approaches used. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to identify differences in students′ conceptual understanding of statics, based on their approach to self-explanation. Results We identified four self-explaining approaches: restricted explanations, elemental explanations, inferential explanations, and strategic explanations. After completing the activity, students who self-explained incomplete worked examples showed better results in the quality of their explanations and conceptual change than students in the incorrect worked example condition. Conclusions The findings suggest a relationship between the type of worked example, students' approaches to self-explaining, and their conceptual change and problem-solving skills in statics. To increase the quality of the students' explanations and to improve their conceptual understanding, additional prompts or initial training in self-explaining may be required within the worked-examples context.},

	abstract = {Background Engineering students inconsistently apply equilibrium when solving problems in statics, but few studies have explored why. Visual cognition studies suggest that features of the visual representations we use to teach students influence what domain knowledge they use to solve problems. However, few studies have explored how visual representations influence what problem-solving strategies and domain knowledge students of different levels of expertise use when solving problems that require them to create and coordinate multiple representations. Purpose/Hypothesis This study addressed the following research question: How do students with different levels of expertise coordinate their problem-solving strategies, problem-solving heuristics, and representation features when sketching their shear force and bending moment diagrams? Design/Method We conducted think-aloud interviews while students sketched shear force and bending moment diagrams. These interviews were subsequently analyzed using the constant comparative method to examine the effect of representations on students' problem-solving approaches. Results Three themes emerged from the data: Students used heuristics that are based on perceptually salient features to sketch their shear force and bending moment diagrams; students across levels of expertise rely on the object translation heuristic rather than equilibrium problem-solving schema to sketch and reason through their shear force and bending moment diagrams, and domain knowledge aids students' ability to resolve conflicting heuristics. Our findings suggest that students primarily rely on heuristics triggered by representation features they notice. Conclusions Students engaged with shear force and bending moment diagrams not as a way to describe systems that are not accelerating but as a series of representations that “should go to zero” or arrows that make things “not zero.”},

To examine the relationship between learning through simulation and achievements in the learning of operation systems in Information and Communications Technology ({ICT}) classes, we developed five simulations on a {FLASH} platform for each unit in the study program. The simulations were accompanied by interactive activity pages. This is a mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) research. The tools included preliminary and summary questionnaires. The sample included 151 high school students, who were divided randomly into two groups: experiment group--learned through online simulations (N=74); control group--learned without simulations (N=77). The findings indicated that students in the experiment group significantly improved their achievements. Also, integrating simulations in learning increased the students' motivation to learn {ICT}, and improved their comprehension of the study topics. The participants in the experiment group noted that learning {ICT} was important, and should be learned at school, as it is closely linked to their everyday lives.},
